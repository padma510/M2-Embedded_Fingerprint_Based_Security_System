# DESIGN:

 * Here we demonstrate fingerprint based security system to authenticate users from entering particular premises.The system is useful for secure sites to provide access only to authorized users automatically. This ensures safety and security at secure sites/premises like military, navy, government as well as corporate premises.
 * For this purpose we here use a Atmega 32 microcontroller circuit. The circuit consists of atmega microcontroller that is interfaced to fingerprint sensor, LCD display and motors to operate a door.
 * Users are allowed to register into the system first. After registration/enrollment the system allows to start monitoring.Now if a fingerprint is detected, the system scans the fingerprint against stored ones.
 * If a match is found, the system operates the motors to open the door for those users, else the system does not open the door.
 * Thus we ensure a secure fingerprint authorized security system.
